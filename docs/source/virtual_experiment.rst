Titan controlled co-simulation
==============================


Titan is meant to be used with a companion `VT-S3FNet <https://github.com/Vignesh2208/VT-S3FNet.git>`_ project. This is a modified S3FNet simulator
which supports co-simulation i.e it can have emulated entities communicate
with each other over simulated networks.

Titan provides tools to compile and extract lookahead from emulated entities.
This process makes them suitable for use in a co-simulation using the modified
S3FNet simulator.


In subsequent sections, we describe how to compile C programs and extract 
lookahead from them using tools provided by Titan.
